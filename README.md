# Git_TrendingRepos_CLI
Trending Repositories CLI is a lightweight Python command-line tool that fetches and displays trending GitHub repositories. Users can filter repositories by a time range—day, week, month, or year—and control how many results are displayed. The tool sorts repositories by star count and presents them in a clean, readable format including repository name, description, star count, and primary language. Designed for simplicity and speed, it leverages the GitHub REST API and includes robust error handling for invalid input or API issues. Perfect for developers who want a quick snapshot of what’s popular on GitHub.
